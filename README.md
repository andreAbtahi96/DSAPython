# DSAPython
This repo is meant to follow along a course on data structures and algorithms using Python(https://uci.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/learn/lecture/3144000#content). 

After jumping between C++(3 semesters worth), Python(1 semester worth), and Java(1 quarter worth).
I believe going into depth and being comfortable with one of these during interviews and what not will be
really important! :)

**Why are you doing this?**

I am taking initiative on my own time to do this, because I have long finished my Data Structures course at UCI and need to brush up on my Data Structures and Algorithms. Additionally, I have to be comfortable and well versed in these DSA for my technical interviews. I intend to familiarize myself with the strengths of each data structure and the time complexities for its various operations. These are simply tools to help me problem solve!

**How will I be updating this repo?**

1. I will be using Jupyter on VS code to write code and participate in exercises/assigned hw.
2. I will be posting pictures of my interpreted written notes of the lectures as well.
I find that writing helps me feel more immersed in the material. 

**What is the timeline for finishing this course?**

The course is 17 hours total. I give my self at minimum an hour every day to focus on programming. I think 17 days seems reasonable, but realistically with the amount of times I stop and reread material, or have events that interupt this time and space. I want to give myself an additional 10 days. So 27 days(BY March 15, 2022). 

**What do you plan on doing after this course?**

After feeling stocked with knowledge and experience getting my hands dirty with DSA. I will continue understanding some core patterns using educative.io. Following this, I will utilize leetcode to stay sharp on problem solving.

**How will you hold yourself accountable?**
I think being motivated isn't enough...so I will continue checking in on LinkedIn with my daily updates!

**TLDR**

(WHILE TRUE) Data Structures and Algorithms -> Patterns for problem solving -> Leet Code
